Vim setup
=========
Place the files 'emil.vim' and 'molcasoutput.vim' in your ~/.vim/syntax
directory. Paste the contents of 'molcasvimrc' in your ~/.vimrc.

Syntax coloring will take effect on any file with extension *.input or *.log.
If you do not want this, uncomment the corresponding autocmd line(s) in
~/.vimrc. If you prefer detection of molcas output files based on file contents
instead of filename, comment out the line in ~/.vimrc and copy the
'scripts.vim' file in your ~/.vim directory.

For the molcas help feature, pressing K (shift-k) while the cursor is on a
keyword in an input file, a buffer will pop up with the relevant molcas help.
Close the buffer with :q as usual. It works with module names, keywords inside
a module, and emil commands (if the line begins with >).

Nedit setup
===========
