# Compute fitting polynomials for Rys roots and weights.
# The TMax values come from the asymptotic.py script.
# For each order, the range [0,TMax] is split in intervals and for each
# interval a set of fitting polynomials is generated that approximate the
# roots and weights within the interval with the desired accuracy.
# Each interval is expanded as much as possible to keep the fitting accuracy.
# The final part of the output is compatible with the "rysrw" file for Molcas.
