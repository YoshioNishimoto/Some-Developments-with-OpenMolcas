            %%Description:
            <HELP>
            A tool to compute molecular properties based on the one-electron density
            or transition-density and one-electron integrals like charges, dipole moments
            and polarizabilities
            </HELP>

The program
:program:`LoProp`
is a tool to compute molecular properties based on the one-electron density
or transition-density and one-electron integrals like charges, dipole moments and polarizabilities.
:program:`LoProp` allows to partition such properties into atomic and interatomic
contributions. The method requires a subdivision of the atomic orbitals into
occupied and virtual basis functions for each atom in the molecular system.
It is a requirement for the approach to have any physical significance that the
basis functions which are classified as "occupied" essentially are the atomic
orbitals of each species. It is therefore advisable to use an ANO type basis set,
or at least a basis set with general contraction.

The localization procedure is organized into a series of orthogonalizations of
the original basis set, which will have as a final result a localized
orthonormal basis set.
**Note that this module does not operate with symmetry.**

A static property, which can be evaluated as an expectation value, like a charge,
a component of the dipole moment or an exchange-hole dipole moment,
is localized by transforming the integrals
of the property and the one-electron density matrix to the new basis and
restricting the trace to the subspace of functions of a single center or the
combination of two centers.

The molecular polarizability is the first order derivative of the dipole moment
with respect to an electric field and the localized molecular polarizability
can be expressed in terms of local responses. In practical terms a calculation
of localized polarizabilities will require to run seven energy calculations. The
first one is in the absence of the field and the other six calculations are in
the presence of the field in the |+-| x,y,z axis respectively.

For a detailed description of the method and its implementation see
:cite:`Gagliardi:04a`.

.. _UG\:sec\:loprop_dependencies:

Dependencies
------------

The dependencies of the :program:`LoProp` module is the union
of the dependencies of the :program:`SEWARD`, and
the program used to perform the energy calculation, namely
the :program:`SCF`, :program:`MBPT2`,
:program:`RASSCF`, or :program:`CASPT2` module. The user
can also provide :program:`LoProp` with a density matrix as input; then
:program:`LoProp` only depends on :program:`SEWARD`. The one-electron
transition density matrix can also be localized to compute, for
example, FÃ¶rster transition probabilities; then :program:`LoProp`
depends on :program:`RASSI` to compute the transition density.

.. _UG\:sec\:loprop_files:

Files
-----

The files of the :program:`LoProp` module is the union
of the files of the :program:`SEWARD` module,
and the :program:`SCF` or :program:`MBPT2`,
or :program:`RASSCF`, or :program:`CASPT2` module.
An exception is if a density matrix is given as input or
when a transition density matrix is localized, see below.

:kword:`ALPHa`
  A parameter in the penalty function used for determining the
  charge fluctuation contribution to the polarizabilities. See eq. 17 in
  :cite:`Gagliardi:04a`. The default value of 7.14 is good for small molecules
  (less than 50 atoms). For larger molecules, a smaller alpha (e.g. 2.0)
  may be needed for numerical stability.

:kword:`BOND`
  Defines the maximum allowed bond length based on the ratio compared to
  Bragg--Slater radii. All contributions in bonds longer than this radius will
  be redistributed to the two atoms involved in the bond, so the the total
  molecular properties are left unaltered. The default value is 1.5.

  Defines the maximum l value for the multipole moments written to the MpProp
  file. If the value specified is larger than the highest multipole moment
  calculated it will be reset to this value, which is also the default value.
  The "MULTipoles" keyword in Seward can change the default value.

  the bond or "OPTImized" in order to let LoProp move the expansion center along
  the bond. The latter is still highly experimental!

:kword:`USERdensity`
  No density matrix is computed instead it is read as an input from the file
  :file:`USERDEN`. This enables :program:`LoProp` to obtain localized
  properties for densities that currently cannot be computed with |molcas|.
  If the keyword :kword:`NOFIeld` is not given, six additional files are
  required (:file:`USERDEN1`--:file:`USERDEN6`), each containing the density matrix of
  a perturbed calculation, see above. Observe the form
  of :file:`USERDEN`, see above.

  .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: UserDensity <basic>
              No density matrix is computed instead it is read as an input from the file
              USERDEN. This enables LoProp to obtain localized
              properties for densities that currently cannot be computed with molcas.

              a perturbed calculation, see above. Observe the form
              of USERDEN, see above.

:kword:`TDENsity`
  This keyword signals that the one-electron density matrix which is to
  be read comes from the TOFILE file generated by :program:`RASSI`. The
  keyword is followed by two integers that gives number of initial and
  final state of the transition. For example, if it is the transition
  density between the first and second state which should be localized,
  the integers should be 1 and 2. The keyword implies :kword:`NOFIeld`

  .. xmldoc:: %%Keyword: TDensity <basic>
              This keyword signals that the one-electron density matrix which is to
              be read comes from the TOFILE file generated by RASSI. The
              keyword is followed by two integers that gives number of initial and
              final state of the transition. For example, if it is the transition
              density between the first and second state which should be localized,
              the integers should be 1 and 2. The keyword implies NOFIeld.
