Core AIMP's
...........

The list of core potentials and valence basis sets
available in the AIMP library follows.
Although AIMP's exist in the literature for different core
sizes, this library includes only those recommended by
the authors after numerical experimentation.
Relativistic CG-AIMP's and NP-AIMP's, respectively, and nonrelativistic NR-AIMP's are included.
Each entry of the CG-AIMP's and the NR-AIMP's in the list is accompanied with a recommended contraction pattern
(to be used in the fifth field).
The NP-AIMP basis sets are given explicitly in the recommended contraction pattern.
For the third-row transition metals two NP-AIMP basis sets are provided which differ
in the number of primitive and contracted f GTFs. For further details, please refer to
the literature :cite:`Rakowitz:99b`.
For more information about a particular entry consult the AIMP library.
