:Description:D
 EMIL commands
:EXPORT:B: :
 A command to export environment variable in a form A=B
:EXIT:B: :
 A command to terminate execution. An optional value for
 this command is the return code (default value is 0)
:INCLUDE:B: :
 A command to include file
 
 >> INCLUDE filename
:FILE:B: :
 A command to inline a file in the input file. The file
 will be extracted into WorkDir before the start of the
 calculation
 
 >> FILE filename
 ...
 >> EOF
:EOF:B: :
 A command to close inlined file.
:SHELL:B: :
 A command to define a unix command to be executed in
 serial.
:EXEC:B: :
 A command to define a unix command to be executed in
 parallel. Note that any special characters are ignored.
:LINK:B: :
 A command to link two files located in WorkDir. The
 command is similar to '!ln -s FILE1 FILE2' but in parallel
 environment it is executed in all WorkDirs. The command
 assumes that FILE1 does exist, and FILE2 does not. >>LINK
 -FORCE allows to link a file FILE1 which does not exist at
 the moment. User should avoid the usage of LINK commands
 in the input.
:COPY:B: :
 A command to copy one file to another. The command is
 similar to '!cp -f /path/to/FILE1 FILE2' but can be used
 also in a parallel environment, in which case it will take
 the source file and distribute to the work directories of
 all processes. The destination must be located in the work
 directory. Note that EMIL command does not allow to use
 masks in the command. If FILE1 does not exist, the command
 returns an error code.
:CLONE:B: :
 A command to make a clone copy of a file, doing a local
 copy on all slaves if parallel. It is mostly used
 internally, e.g. to distribute an input file to all
 WorkDirs.
:COLLECT:B: :
 A command to copy one file to another, collecting files on
 slaves and put them on the master if parallel
:SAVE:B: :
 A command to copy one file to another, only on the master
 if parallel
:RM:B: :
 A command to delete a file. The command is similar to '!rm
 FILE' but can be used also in parallel environment. Note
 that EMIL command does not allow to use masks in the
 command. An attempt to remove non existent file leads to
 an error. It is possible to use -FORCE flag to allow
 deleting of non-existent file.

 directly from the density matrices in the RUN*** files.
:Occupation:B: :
 The number of average orbitals with an occupation higher
 than this number is reported for each symmetry. The
 default is 1.0d-5.
[CASPT2]
:Description:D
 The CASPT2 program is used to compute a dynamic
 correlation correction to a RASSCF energy, and optionally
 to the density matrix and properties. It can be regarded
 as a Møller-Plesset perturbation method through second
 order (MP2), except that is is equally useful for general
 RASSCF root functions, also excited states, regardless of
 symmetry and multiplicity.
:Title:B: :
 Enter one title line for this job.
:Multistate:B:GUI:list:
 Enter the number of states for CASPT2 to compute, and a
 list of numbers showing which CASSCF state to use as root
 state for each. Alternatively, enter "all" for all the
 states included in the CASSCF orbital optimization.
:XMultistate:B:GUI:list:
 Enter the number of states for CASPT2 to compute, and a
 list of numbers showing which CASSCF state to use as root
 state for each. Alternatively, enter "all" for all the
 states included in the CASSCF orbital optimization.
:IPEAshift:B:GUI:number:
 Parameter (Default 0.25), adds a shift dependent on
 density matrix for active orbitals, reducing overestimated
 correlation energy for open shells.
:Imaginary:A:GUI:number:
 Add an imaginary shift (Default 0.0) to eliminate weak
 intruders.
:Shift:A:GUI:number:
 Add a shift to the external part of the zero order
 Hamiltonian, which may shift away weak intruders.
 Imaginary shift is better.
:AFREeze:A: :
 This keyword is used to select atoms for defining the
 correlation orbital space for the CASPT2 calculation.
 Inactive orbitals with Mulliken populations smaller than a
 given threshold on the selected atoms will be frozen and
 virtual orbitals will be deleted. The next line give the
 number of atoms and selection thresholds. An additional
 line gives the names of the atoms as defined in the Seward
 input. Use with care! Not much tested yet, but is very
 effective in reducing the computational time for CASPT2 in
 large molecules.
:LOVC:A: :
 "Freeze-and-Delete" type of CASPT2, available only in
 connection with Cholesky or RI. Needs (pseudo)canonical
 orbitals from RASSCF. An example of input for the keyword
 LOVC is the following:
 
 LovCASPT2
  0.3
 DoMP2  (or DoEnv)
 
 In this case, both occupied and virtual orbitals
 (localized by the program) are divided in two groups:
 those mainly located on the region determined
 (automatically) by the spatial extent of the active
 orbitals ("active site"), and the remaining ones, which
 are obviously "outside" this region. The value of the
 threshold (between 0 and 1) is used to perform this
 selection (in the example, 30% of the gross Mulliken
 population of a given orbital on the active site). By
 default, the CASPT2 calculation is performed only for the
 correlating orbitals associated with the active site. The
 keyword DoMP2 is optional and forces the program to
 perform also an MP2 calculation on the "frozen region".
 Alternatively, one can specify the keyword VirAll in order
 to use all virtual orbitals as correlating space for the
 occupied orbitals of the active site. A third possibility
 is to use the keyword DoEnv to compute the energy of the
 environment as total MP2 energy minus the MP2 energy of
 the active site.
:FNOC:A: :
 Performs a Frozen Natural Orbital (FNO) CASPT2
 calculation, available only in combination with Cholesky
 or RI integral representation. Needs (pseudo)canonical
 orbitals from RASSCF. An example of input for the keyword
 FNOC is the following:
 
 FNOCaspt2
  0.4
 DoMP2
 
 The keyword FNOC has one compulsory argument (real number
 in ]0,1]) specifying the fraction of virtual orbitals (in
 each irrep) to be retained in the FNO-CASPT2 calculation.
 The keyword DoMP2 is optional and used to compute the
 (estimated) correction for the truncation error.
:Focktype:B:GUI:select(G1,G2,G3):
 Present choices: G1, G2, G3. Refers to modified Fock
 matrices (See manual). It is better to use the default
 IPEA shift.
:Frozen:A:GUI:list:
 Replace default number of frozen orbitals of each symmetry
 type with user input. Default: Those that were frozen in
 the RASSCF, or standard table dependent on basis set,
 whichever is larger.
:Deleted:A: :
 Replace default number of deleted orbitals of each
 symmetry type with user input. Default: Those that were
 deleted in the RASSCF.
:Density:A: :
 Force calculation of accurate density matrix from the
 CASPT2 wave function. Used for dipole moments, etc.
:RFPert:A: :

 to the one-electron Hamiltonian. The perturbation is
 extracted from RUNOLD if it exists, otherwise from
 RUNFILE.

 Which root to use in a geometry optimization of a
 multi-state CASPT2 wave function. Default: root defined by
 RLXROOT in the RASSCF module, if any, else the highest
 root.
:Thresholds:A: :
 The first threshold is for removing redundant excitations,
 the second is for removing linear dependences of
 standardized linear equation system. Default: 1.0d-10 and
 1.0d-08.
:MaxIter:A: :
 The maximum allowed number of iterations. (Zero iterations
 gives diagonal approximation. Default:20)
:Convergence:A: :
 Convergence threshold for norm of residual vector. Default
 1.0d-06
:NoMix:A: :
 Do not produce a JobMix file, even if this is a
 multi-state calculation.
:NoMultistate:B: :
 Do just a series of independent CASPT2 runs, without any
 multi-state coupling. Useful when many roots are required,
 but multi-state is not needed, or desired.
:ONLY:A: :
 This keyword requires the MULTistate or XMULtistate
 keyword, and is followed by an integer specifying one of
 the roots. In a Multistate calculation, it requests to
 compute the energy of only the specified root. However,
 the effective Hamiltonian coupling terms between this root
 and all the others included in the Multistate treatment
 will be computed and printed out. This output will be used
 in a subsequent calculation, in conjunction with the EFFE
 keyword.
:EFFE:A: :
 This keyword requires the MULTistate or XMULtistate
 keyword. It is followed by the number of states and a
 matrix of real numbers, specifying the effective
 Hamiltonian couplings, as provided in a previous
 calculation using the ONLY keyword. In a (Extended)
 Multistate calculation over, e.g., 3 states, 3 separate
 calculations with the ONLY keyword will be performed,
 possibly on separate computing nodes, so as to speed up
 the overall process. The three couplings vectors will be
 given to the EFFE keyword in matrix form, i.e. the first
 column is made by the couplings of the first computed
 root, etc. The program will then quickly compute the
 (Extended) Multistate energies.
:NoOrbitals:B: :
 Skip printing of the MO orbitals.
:Properties:B: :
 Compute (approximate) density matrix, natural orbitals and
 properties.
:NoTransform:A: :
 Prevent transformation to pseudo-canonical orbitals, even
 if CASPT2 would assumed this is needed (Default is:
 transform when assumed necessary.)
:Transform:A: :
 Demand transformation to pseudo-canonical orbitals even if
 this was specified as option of CASSCF so it ought to be
 unnecessary. (Default is: transform only when assumed
 necessary.)
:OFEM:A: :
 Adds an Orbital-Free Embedding potential to the
 Hamiltonian. Available only in combination with Cholesky
 or RI integral representation. No arguments required. The
 runfile of the environment subsystem (AUXRFIL) must be
 available.
:GHOS:A: :
 Excludes from PT2 treatment orbitals localized on ghost
 atoms. A threshold for this selection must be specified.
:OUTPut:B: :
 BRIEF gives a very short orbital listing, DEFAULT a normal
 output, and LONG a detailed listing.
:PRWF:A: :
 Threshold for printing CI coefficients. Default 0.05.
:PRSD:A: :
 Activate printing of CSFs in terms of determinants.
:CHEMps2:B: :
 Activate DMRG-CASPT2 calculation with Molcas-CheMPS2
 interface.
:CUMUlant:B: :
 Activate DMRG-cu(4)-CASPT2 calculation with Molcas-Block
 interface.

[EXPBAS]
:Description:D
 This module is used to manipulate orbital files. By
 default it is used to expand the orbital file to a larger
 basis set. This feature is available only for generally
 contracted basis sets (ANO or CC). The original orbital
 file INPORB is needed. By default, the Runfile, RUNFIL1,
 from the small calculation is also needed. One runs also
 the GATEWAY module with the larger basis set to obtain the
 corresponding runfile, RUNFIL2. The program will produce
 the file EXPORB, which can be used as the input orbital
 file for calculations using the larger basis set. The
 DESYmmetrize keyword is used to transform orbitals with
 symmetry to C1 symmetry. If one wants to desymmetrize the
 orbitals without expanding the basis set, the keyword
 NOEXpand must be used. When the DESY keyword is used, in
 combination with NOEXpand, only the INPORB file is needed.
 One runs the GATEWAY module with the same basis set of the
 original orbital file to obtain the corresponding runfile.
 The program will produce in output the DESORB file. In any
 subsequent calculation using the DESORB file, modified
 Cartesian coordinates are required, the ones internally
 generated by Molcas and printed out in the GATEWAY section
 of the output.
:NOEX:B: :
 Deactivates the basis set expansion.
:DESY:B: :

 fields which are: Label, component and perturbation
 strength. The label consists of a character string of
 length 8 and names the one-electron integrals produced by
 SEWARD. The last parameter denotes the strength of a

 automatically, but sometimes it may be useful to enforce
 it.
:Numerical:A: :
 Forces the calculation of numerical gradients even when
 analytic gradients are available.
:Shake:A: :
 Randomly modifies the initial coordinates of the atoms,
 maintaining the input (or computed) symmetry. This can be
 useful to avoid a geometry optimization converging to a
 higher-symmetry saddle point. The maximum displacement in
 the axes x, y and z is read from the following real
 number. This number can be followed by Bohr or Angstrom,
 which indicates the unit in which the displacement is
 specified, the default is Bohr.

 which the optimization is subject to. This section is
 always ended by the keyword "End of Constraints". Consult
 the manual for the details.

 restrictions for numerical differentiation. This section
 is always ended by the keyword "End of NGExclude".
:RIJ:B: :

 approach to treat the two-electron integrals. Note that
 the valence basis set must have a supporting auxiliary
 basis set for this to work.
:RIJK:B: :
 Use the RI-JK auxiliary basis in the density fitting (DF)
 approach to treat the two-electron integrals. Note that
 the valence basis set must have a supporting auxiliary
 basis set for this to work.
:RIC:B: :
 Use the RI-C auxiliary basis in the density fitting (DF)
 approach to treat the two-electron integrals. Note that
 the valence basis set must have a supporting auxiliary
 basis set for this to work.
:RICD:B: :
 Use the aCD or acCD approach to treat the two-electron
 integrals. This procedure will use an on-the-fly generated
 auxiliary basis set.
:CDThreshold:A: :

 auxiliary basis sets for RI calculations (default value
 1.0d-4).

:End of RF-input:B: :
 This marks the end of the input to the reaction field
 utility.
:Reaction field (RF):B: :
 This command is exclusive to the Kirkwood model. This
 indicated the beginning of the specification of the
 reaction field parameters. The subsequent line will
 contain the dielectric constant of the medium, the radius
 of the cavity in Bohrs (the cavity is always centered
 around the origin), and the angular quantum number of the
 highest multipole moment used in the expansion of the
 change distribution of the molecule (only charge is
 specified as 0, charge and dipole moments as 1, etc.). The
 input specified below specifies that a dielectric
 permitivity of 80.0 is used, that the cavity radius is
 14.00 a.u., and that the expansion of the charge
 distribution is truncated after l=4, i.e. hexadecapole
 moments are the last moments included in the expansion.
 Optionally a fourth argument can be added giving the value
 of the dielectric constant of the fast component of the
 solvent (default value 1.0).
:PCM-model (RF):B: :
 If no other keywords are specified, the program will
 execute a standard PCM calculation with water as solvent.
 The solvent reaction field will be included in all the
 programs (SCF, RASSCF, CASPT2, etc.) invoked after SEWARD:
 note that in some cases additional keywords are required
 in the corresponding program sections. Many PCM parameters
 can be changed through the following keywords.
:Solvent (RF):B: :
 Used to indicate which solvent is to be simulated. The
 name of the requested solvent must be written in the line
 below this keyword. Allowed solvents are: WATER,
 ACETONITRILE, METHANOL, ETHANOL, ISOQUINOLINE, QUINOLINE,
 CHLOROFORM, ETHYLETHER, METHYLENECHLORIDE, DICHLOROETHANE,
 CARBONTETRACHLORIDE, BENZENE, TOLUENE, CHLOROBENZENE,
 NITROMETHANE, HEPTANE, CYCLOHEXANE, ANILINE, ACETONE,
 TETRAHYDROFURAN, DIMETHYLSULFOXIDE, ARGON, KRYPTON, XENON
:Dielectric constant (RF):B: :
 Defines a different dielectric constant for the selected
 solvent; useful to describe the system at temperatures
 other that 298 K, or to mimic solvent mixtures. The value
 is read in the line below the keyword. An optional second
 value might be added on the same line which defines a
 different value for the infinite frequency dielectric
 constant for the selected solvent (this is used in
 non-equilibrium calculations; by default it is defined for
 each solvent at 298 K).
:Conductor version (RF):A: :
 It requires a PCM calculation where the solvent is
 represented as a polarized conductor: this is an
 approximation to the dielectric model which works very
 well for polar solvents (i.e. dielectric constant greater
 than about 5), and it has some computational advantages
 being based on simpler equations. It can be useful in
 cases when the dielectric model shows some convergence
 problems.
:AAREa (RF):A: :
 It is used to define the average area (in A^2) of the
 small elements on the cavity surface where solvation
 charges are placed; when larger elements are chosen, less
 charges are defined, what speeds up the calculation but
 risks to worsen the results. The default value is 0.4 A^2
 (i.e. 60 charges on a sphere of radius 2 A). The value is
 read in the line below the keyword.
:R-min (RF):A: :
 It sets the minimum radius (in A) of the spheres that the
 program adds to the atomic spheres in order to smooth the
 cavity surface (default 0.2 A). For large solute, if the
 programs complains that too many sphere are being created,
 or if computational times become too high, it can be
 useful to enlarge this value (for example to 1 or 1.5 A),
 thus reducing the number of added spheres. The value is
 read in the line below the keyword.
:Pauling (RF):A: :
 It invokes the use of Pauling's radii to build the solute
 cavity: in this case, hydrogens get their own sphere
 (radius 1.2 A).
:Sphere radius (RF):A: :
 It is used to provide sphere radii from input: for each
 sphere given explicitly by the user, the keyword 'Sphere
 radius' is required, followed by a line containing two
 numbers: an integer indicating the atom where the sphere
 has to be centered, and a real indicating its radius (in
 A). For example, 'Sphere radius' followed by '3 1.5'
 indicates that a sphere of radius 1.5 A is placed around
 atom 3; 'Sphere radius' followed by '4 2.0' indicates that
 another sphere of radius 2 A is placed around atom 4 and
 so on.
:FNMC:A: :
 Request that the so-called Finite Nuclear Mass Correction,
 excluded by the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, be added
 to the one-electron Hamiltonian.
:Well integrals:B: :
 Request computation of Pauli repulsion integrals for
 dielectric cavity reaction field calculations. The first
 line specifies the total number of primitive well
 integrals in the repulsion integral. Then follows a number
 of lines, one for each well integral, specifying the
 coefficient of the well integral in the linear combination
 of the well integrals which defines the repulsion
 integral, the exponent of the well integral, and the
 distance of the center of the Gaussian from the origin. In
 total three entries on each line. All entries in atomic
 units. If zero or a negative number is specified for the
 number of well integrals a standard set of 3 integrals
 with their position adjusted for the radius of the cavity
 will be used. If the distance of the center of the
 Gaussian from the origin is negative displacements
 relative to the cavity radius is assumed.
:Xfield integrals:B: :
 Request the presence of an external electric field
 represented by a number of partial charges and dipoles.
 Optionally, polarisabilities may be specified whose
 induced dipoles are determined self-consistently during
 the SCF iteration. The first line may contain, apart from
 the first integer (nXF) (number of centers), up to four
 additional integers. The second integer (nOrd) specifies
 the maximum multipole order, or -1 signifying no permanent
 multipoles. Default is 1 (charges and dipoles). The third
 integer (p) specifies the type of external
 polarisabilities: 0 (default) no polarisabilities, 1
 (isotropic), or 2 (anisotropic). The fourth integer
 (nFrag) specifies the number of fragments one multipole
 may contribute to (relevant only if polarisabilities are
 present). The default is 0, meaning that each permanent
 multipole is only excluded in the calculation of the field
 at its own polarisability, 1 means that one gives a
 fragment number to each multipole and that the static
 multipoles do not contribute to the polarising field
 within the same fragment, whereas 2 can be used in more
 complex situations, e.g. polymers, allowing you to specify
 a second fragment number so that junction atoms does not
 contribute to either of the neighbouring fragments.
 Finally, the fifth and last integer (nRead) (relevant only
 if Langevin dipoles are used) may be 0 or 1 (where 0 is
 default), specifying wheather an element number (e.g. 8
 for oxygen) should be read for each multipole. In that
 case the default radius for that element is used to
 determine which Langevin grid points should be
 annihilated. A negative element number signifies that a
 particular radius should be used for that multipole, in
 thousands of a Bohr (-1400 meaning 1.4 Bohr). Then follows
 nXF lines, one for each center. On each line is first
 nFrag+nRead (which may equal 0) integers, specifying the
 fragments that the multipole should not contribute to (the
 first fragment is taken as the fragment that the
 polarisability belongs to) and the element number. Then
 follows the three coordinates of the center, followed by
 the multipoles and polarisabilities. The number of
 multipole entries is 0 for nOrd=-1, 1 for nOrd=0, 4 for
 nOrd=1, and 10 for nOrd=2. The number of polarisability
 entries are 0 for p=0, 1 for p=1, and 6 for p=2. The order
 of quadrupole moment and anisotropic polarisability
 entries is xx, xy, xz, yy, yz, zz. If default is used,
 i.e. only specifying the number of centers on the first
 line, each of these lines will contain 7 entries
 (coordinates, charge, and dipole vector). All entries are
 in atomic units, if not otherwise requested by the
 Angstrom keyword that must be placed between nXF and nOrd.
 All these data can be stored in a separate file whose name
 must be passed as an argument of the XField keyword.

 one entry for each origin.
:EPOT:B: :

 point. This keyword is mutually exclusive with EFLD and
 FLDG.
:EFLD:B: :
 Followed by a card with an integer entry which represents
 the number of points for which the electric potential and

 each point have to be supplied, one entry for each point.
 This keyword is mutually exclusive with EPOT and FLDG.
:FLDG:B: :
 An integer required which represents the number of points
 for which the electric potential, electric field and
 electric field gradient will be computed. If this number
 is zero, the electric field gradient acting on each
 nucleus will be computed. If nonzero, then either the
 coordinates (in au) for each point or labels for each atom
 center have to be supplied, one entry for each point. In
 case a label is supplied it must match one of those given
 previous in the input during specification of the
 coordinates of the atom centers. Using a label instead of
 a coordinate can e.g. be useful in something like a
 geometry optimization where the coordinate isn't known
 when the input is written. This keyword is mutually
 exclusive with EPOT and EFLD.

 Saddle method. Note that the order of the coordinates must
 always match the order specified with the conventional
 input of the coordinates of the molecular system.
 Alternatively, two lines with the filenames containing the
 coordinates of reactants and products, respectively, (in
 XYZ format) can be given.
:NoAlign:A: :
 By default, the two starting structures are aligned to
 minimize the root mean square distance (RMSD) between
 them, in particular, the first structure is moved and the
 second structure remains fixed. If this keyword is given,
 the starting structures are used as given.
:AlignOnly:A: :
 The two starting structures are aligned, but nothing more
 is done. An input block for SEWARD is still needed, but no
 integrals are computed.
:Weights:A: :

 for the calculation of the "distance" between structures.
 The possibilities are: MASS: This is the default. Each
 atom is given a weight proportional to its mass.
 Equivalent to mass-weighted coordinates. EQUAL: All atoms
 have an equal weight. HEAVY: Only heavy atoms are
 considered, with equal weights. Hydrogens are given zero
 weight. A list of N numbers can also be provided, and they
 will be used as weights for the N symmetry-unique atoms.
:SaddleStep:A: :

 method. The value is given in weighted coordinates,
 divided by the square root of the total weight (see the

 optimization type (1 = steepest descent, 2 = mixed, 3 =
 Newton's method), a second line with a real number
 specifying a step factor and if using type "mixed" a third
 line with a real number specifying the maximum gradient
 size for which steepest descent is used.
:OldZ:A: :
 Start new calculation based on $Project.GEO/$Project.zmt
:zonly:A: :
 A z-matrix ($Project.zmt) is printed in the
 $Project.GEO-directory. The optimization parameters are
 set so that each fragment is kept rigid and only
 coordinates linking fragments are optimized.
:zcons:A: :
 Prints a file with a constraints-definition for rigid
 fragments formatted for use in slapaf ($Project.cns) and
 an xyz-file (cons.xyz) with the same atom number. Both
 files are printed in the $Project.GEO-directory.
:origin:A: :
 Followed by two lines for each fragment. The first line

 should be imported from GROMACS. The keyword should be
 followed by one of the options SIMPLE or CASTMM on the
 next line. In the case of SIMPLE, all MM atoms defined in
 the GROMACS input will be treated as outer MM atoms in
 MOLCAS. This means, for example, that in a geometry
 optimization, their positions will be updated using
 microiterations rather than the conventional optimization
 scheme. Conversely, CASTMM requests that certain MM atoms
 should be treated as inner MM atoms in MOLCAS. Their
 positions will be updated with the same scheme as used for
 the QM atoms. The CASTMM option should be followed by two
 additional input lines, the first one containing the
 number of MM atoms to convert from outer to inner type,
 and the second containing a list of those atoms (using
 their corresponding GROMACS indices).
:LinkAtoms:A: :
 Defines link atoms for use with the Morokuma updating
 scheme (MOLCAS/GROMACS calculations only). The desired
 number of link atoms should be given as an integer on the
 next line. This should be followed by additional input

 definition should be of the form ILA, IQM, IMM, SCALE,
 where ILA, IQM and IMM are the GROMACS indices of the link
 atom and the corresponding QM and MM frontier atoms,
 respectively. SCALE is the scaling factor to be used in
 the Morokuma scheme. Note that each link atom must be
 defined as a QM atom in the GROMACS input. In addition,
 the frontier MM atom must be an inner MM atom specified
 with the GROMACS keyword in GATEWAY.

 This keyword enables automatic generation of rydberg
 orbitals. With this keyword all occupied orbitals will get
 occupation number zero while the virtual orbitals will get
 a small occupation number decreasing with orbital number.

 orbitals are near perfect rydberg orbitals. Note that you
 must use orbitals from the SCF or RASSCF program. This

[LOPROP]
:Description:D
 A tool to compute molecular properties based on the
 one-electron density or transition-density and
 one-electron integrals like charges, dipole moments and
 polarizabilities
:NoField:B: :
 The calculation is run in the absence of a field and only
 static properties like charges and dipole moments are
 computed. The default is to go beyond the static
 properties.
:Delta:B: :
 The magnitude of the electric field in the finite field
 perturbation calculations to determine the
 polarizabilities. Default value is 0.001 au.
:Alpha:B: :
 A parameter in the penalty function used for determining
 the charge fluctuation contribution to the
 polarizabilities. See eq. 17 in Gagliardi et al, JCP
 121,4497. The default value of 7.14 is good for small
 molecules (less than 50 atoms). For larger molecules, a
 smaller alpha (e.g. 2.0) may be needed for numerical
 stability.
:Bond:B: :
 Defines the maximum allowed bond length based on the ratio
 compared to Bragg-Slater radii. All contributions in bonds
 longer than this radius will be redistributed to the two
 atoms involved in the bond, so the the total molecular
 properties are left unaltered. The default value is 1.5.
:MpProp:B: :
 Defines the maximum l value for the multipole moments
 written to the MpProp file. If the value specified is
 larger than the highest multipole moment calculated it
 will be reset to this value, which is also the default
 value. The 'MULTipoles' keyword in Seward can change the
 default value.
:Expansion center:B: :
 Defines which points will be used as the expansion centers
 for the bonds. The next line must contain either
 'MIDPoint' in order just to use the midpoint of the bond
 or 'OPTImized' in order to let LoProp move the expansion
 center along the bond. The latter is still highly
 experimental!
:UserDensity:B: :
 No density matrix is computed instead it is read as an
 input from the file USERDEN. This enables LoProp to obtain
 localized properties for densities that currently can not
 be computed with molcas. If the keyword NOFIeld is not
 given, six additional files are required
 (USERDEN1-USERDEN6), each containing the density matrix of
 a perturbed calculation, see above. Observe the form of
 USERDEN, see above.
:TDensity:B: :
 This keyword signals that the one-electron density matrix
 which is to be read comes from the TOFILE file generated
 by RASSI. The keyword is followed by two integers that
 gives number of initial and final state of the transition.
 For example, if it is the transition density between the
 first and second state which should be localized, the
 integers should be 1 and 2. The keyword implies NOFIeld.
:XHole:B: :
 The exchange hole dipole moment is computed, localized and
 given as additional output. This quantity can be used to
 compute local dispersion coefficients according to Becke
 and Johnson. The numerical integration routine in Molcas
 is used.

 integers. Incompatible with the FREEze keyword. Default is
 to freeze non-valence orbitals.
:Deleted:A: :
 Specifies the number of deleted orbitals in each irrep of
 the point group. The orbitals with the highest energies
 are deleted. The keyword takes as argument nIrrep (# of
 irreps) integers. NOTE: Those orbitals, which have been
 deleted already in the SCF calculation (cf. SPDElete,
 OVLDelete of the SCF program description) are never seen
 by the MBPT2 program and hence are not to be deleted again
 with the present option.
:Sfrozen:A: :
 Allows to specify specific orbitals to freeze in each of
 the irreducible representations (irreps) of the subgroup
 of D2h in which the system is represented. In the 1st line
 after the keyword the number of orbitals to freeze for
 each irrep is specified (nIrrep (# of irreps) integers).
 The next <= nIrrep lines reference the orbitals to freeze
 for the related irrep, following an enumeration of the
 individual orbitals of 1, 2, 3,... according to increasing
 orbital energy. Note that the orbital reference numbers
 obey the original ordering and also include those orbitals
 which may have been frozen already by the FROZEN option.
 If the corresponding irrep does not contain any specific
 orbitals to freeze (i.e. a zero was supplied for this
 irrep in the 1st line), no line orbital reference input
 line is supplied for that irrep.
:Sdeleted:A: :
 Allows to specify specific orbitals to delete in each of
 the irreducible representations (irreps) of the subgroup
 of D2h in which the system is represented. In the 1st line
 after the keyword the number of orbitals to delete for

 The next <= nIrrep lines reference the orbitals to delete
 for the related irrep, following an enumeration of the
 individual orbitals of 1, 2, 3,... according to increasing
 orbital energy. Note that the orbital reference numbers
 obey the original ordering. If the corresponding irrep
 does not contain any specific orbitals to freeze (i.e. a
 zero was supplied for this irrep in the 1st line), no line
 orbital reference input line is supplied for that irrep.

 C1 N    (Center labels)
 DoMP2
 
 In this case, both occupied and virtual orbitals
 (localized by the program) are divided in two groups:
 those (A) mainly located on the two (symmetry independent)
 centers C1 and N, and the remaining ones (B), which are
 obviously "outside" this region. The value of the
 threshold (between 0 and 1) is used to perform this
 selection (in the example, 20% of the gross Mulliken
 population of a given orbital on the specified atoms). By
 default, the MP2 calculation is performed only for the
 correlating orbitals associated with the region A ("active
 site"). The keyword DoMP2 is optional and forces the
 program to perform also an independent MP2 calculation on
 the "frozen region" (B). Alternatively, one can specify
 the keyword VirAll in order to use all virtual orbitals as
 correlating space for the occupied orbitals of the active
 site.
:FNOM:A: :
 Performs a Frozen Natural Orbital (FNO) MP2 calculation,
 available only in combination with Cholesky or RI integral
 representation An example of input for the keyword FNOM is

 with the MCLR program. GEOMetry calculates only those
 parts of the geometrical Hessian that correspond to
 symmetry allowed displacements (Could be used in a second
 order geometry optimization). The default is to compute
 the Hessian for vibrational frequency calculations.

 This input is used to set to zero specific coefficients of
 the input orbitals. The option is, for instance, of great
 value if the symmetry of a molecule is higher than given
 by input and hence the trial orbitals are contaminated by
 components of lower symmetry. The restrictions are
 introduced by grouping orbitals of the same symmetry into
 additional classes. Orbitals belonging to a given classes
 are requested to obey a set of rules. In addition, all
 orbitals not belonging to that class, can be requested to
 obey another set of rules. Here, a rule is defined as
 being identical to the instruction: set coefficient i in
 orbital j to zero.  The keyword requires at least one line
 of input per symmetry specifying the number of additional
 classes in this symmetry (a 0 (zero) denotes that there is
 no additional classes). If the number of additional
 classes is not zero then the program expects for each
 classes three lines of input: The first entry includes as
 first datum the dimension of the class followed by the
 list of orbitals included in this class. The second entry
 defines the set of rules which are applied to all orbitals
 within the class. The first datum defines the number of
 MO-coefficients to be set to zero and is followed by a
 list of which coefficients are to be touched. Finally, the
 third entry of input define the set of rules to be applied

 LDA5, PBE and BLYP available at the moment). The OPTIONAL
 keyword dFMD has two arguments: first, the fraction of
 correlation potential to be added to the OFE potential;

 used in a freeze-and-thaw cycle (EMIL Do While) to specify
 the (subsystems) energy convergence threshold.

 maximum number of iterations used in the orbital
 optimization section. Default and maximum values are
 200,100.

 the manual! This input is used to restrict possible
 orbital rotations. The restrictions are introduced by
 grouping orbitals of the same symmetry into additional
 classes. Orbitals belonging to different classes are not
 allowed to mix up during optimization. The input requires
 at least one entry per symmetry specifying the number of
 additional classes in this symmetry (a 0 (zero) denotes
 that there is no additional classes). If the number of
 additional classes is not zero then the program expects
 for each classes the following input: The dimension of the
 classes and the list of orbitals in the classes counted
 relative to the first orbital in this symmetry.

 other correlated methods, because the energies of the
 virtual orbitals are undefined. This keyword is equivalent

[RASSI]
:Description:D
 The RASSI program calculates overlaps, and matrix elements
 of one-electron operators, and of the electronic
 Hamiltonian, over a basis of RASSCF wave functions, which
 may each have its own independent set of orbitals.
 Energies and matrix elements are computed also for the
 non-interacting linear combinations of states, i.e., doing
 a limited CI using the RASSCF states as a non-orthogonal
 basis. RASSI is extensively used for computing dipole
 oscillator strengths. Finally, it can also compute e.g.

 The spin-free effective Hamiltonian is assumed to be
 diagonal, with energies being read from a JOBIPH or JOBMIX
 file from e.g. a multi-state CASPT2 calculation.
:TOfile:B: :
 Signals that a set of files with data from Rassi should be

 functions.

 Demand printing expectation values of all selected
 one-electron properties, for the spin-orbit states.

 This computes the g matrix and principal g values for the
 states lying within the energy range supplied on the next
 line. A value of 0.0D0 or negative will select only the
 ground state, a value E will select all states within
 energy E of the ground state. The states should be ordered
 by increasing energy in the input. The angular momentum
 and spin-orbit coupling matrix elements need to be
 available (use keywords SPIN and PROP).
:Magnetic properties:A: :
 This computes the magnetic moment and magnetic
 susceptibility. On the next two lines you have to provide
 the magnetic field and temperature data. On the first line
 put the number of magnetic field steps, the starting field
 (in Tesla), size of the steps (in Tesla), and an angular
 resolution for sampling points in case of powder
 magnetization (for a value of 0.0d0 the powder
 magnetization is deactivated). The second line reads the
 number of temperature steps, the starting temperature (K),
 and the size of the temperature steps (K). The angular

:Description:D
 This module is still undocumented
[SCF]
:Description:D
 The SCF program of the molcas program system generates
 closed-shell Hartree-Fock, open-shell UHF, and Kohn Sham
 DFT wave functions.
:Title:B: :
 One line for the title
:UHF:B:GUI:keyword:
 Use this keyword to run Unrestricted Hartree-Fock code
 Note that current implementation of UHF code has some
 restrictions, and not all features of SCF program are
 supported
:zSpin:B: :
 Use this keyword to specify the difference in the number
 of alpha and beta electrons in the system. The default is
 0 or 1 depending on if there is an even or odd number of
 electrons. This keyword is not needed when you specify the
 number of electrons with the keyword OCCUpied.
:Spin:B: :
 The keyword is followed by an integer giving the value of
 spin multiplicity (2S+1). Default is 1 (singlet) or 2
 (doublet) depending on if there is an even or odd number
 of electrons.
:KSDFT:B: :
 Use this keyword to do density functional theory
 calculations This keyword should be followed by the
 functional keyword: BLYP, B3LYP, B3LYP5, HFB, HFS, LDA,
 LDA5, LSDA, LSDA5, SVWN, SVWN5, TLYP, PBE, PBE0, M06,
 M062X, M06HF, M06L. Example: KSDFT=B3LYP
:DFCF:A: :
 Use this keyword to scale the exchange terms and/or
 correlation terms of a density functional. This keyword
 should be followed by the scaling factor for the exchange
 terms and the scaling factor for the correlation terms,
 separated by a space. If the values are 1.0 (default),
 then the original density functional is used. For an
 HLE-type functional, use 1.25 (for exchange) and 0.5 (for
 correlation). Example: DFCF=1.25 0.5
:Charge:B: :
 Use this keyword to set the number of electrons in the
 system. This number is defined by giving the net charge of
 the system. If this keyword is not specified, the molecule
 is assumed to have net charge zero. The input is given as
 
 Charge=n
 
 where n is the charge of the system.
:Occupied:B: :
 Use this keyword to set the number of electrons in the
 system. This number is defined by giving the number of
 electron pairs per irreducible representation of the
 subgroup of D2h used in the calculation. You can use one
 and only one of the keywords, CHARge and OCCUpied for this
 purpose. If neither of these keywords are specified CHARge
 is assumed with a net charge of zero. It should be noted
 that the "fermi aufbau" procedure is not used when you
 specify this keyword. The input for one of the point
 groups D2, C2h or C2v is given as
 
 OCCUpied= n1 n2 n3 n4
 
 where n1 is the number of electron pairs (occupied
 orbitals) in the first irreducible representation, etc. If
 UHF keyword was specified, occupation numbers must be
 specified in two lines: for alpha and beta spins
:Fermi:B:GUI:number:
 Use this keyword to specify that you want to use the
 "Fermi aufbau" procedure for the first few iterations to
 ensure convergence. The orbitals will be partially
 populated according to a Fermi population. The input is
 gives as
 
 Fermi= m
 
 where m is the temperature parameter according to
 
 m=0: No temperature is used. Not recommended.
 m=1: A low temperature is used and will yield swift convergence
      for well behaved systems.
 m=2: A medium low temperature is used and will yield swift and
      safe convergence for most systems. This is the default value.
 m=3: A medium temperature is used and you will obtain good
      convergence for closed shell systems. If the system is not
      a closed shell system, the temperature dependent aufbau
      procedure may not terminate. This will result in a density
      matrix with fractional occupation numbers.
 m=4: A medium high temperature is used and the temperature
      dependent aufbau procedure will most probably not terminate.
      This is useful for generating starting orbitals for an MCSCF
      calculation.
 m=5: A high temperature is used. Behaves as m=4 only more so.
 
 It should be noted that only dynamic damping is used until
 the program have found a stable closed shell
 configuration. When this have happened the more efficient
 methods: the ordinary C2-DIIS and the second order
 update/C2-DIIS procedure, are enabled.
:Iterations:B: :
 Specifies the maximum number of iterations. The default is
 400 which is also the largest number you can specify.
:Cholesky:A: :
 Use of Cholesky (or RI/DF) representation for the
 two-electron integrals with default SCF settings.
:Choinput:A: :
 Manually modify the settings of the Cholesky SCF.
:NoLK:A: :
 Deactivates LK screening. Available only within ChoInput.
:dmpK:A: :
 Modifies the thresholds used in the LK screening.
 Available only within ChoInput The default value is 1.0d0.
 A smaller value results in a slower but more accurate
 calculation.
:NODE:A: :
 The Exchange contribution to the Fock matrix is computed
 using occupied canonical orbitals instead of (localized)
 "Cholesky MOs". Available only within ChoInput.
:CONS:A: :
 Performs a Constrained (Natural Orbitals) SCF calculation,
 available only in combination with Cholesky or RI integral
 representation. An example of input for the keyword CONS
 is the following:
 
 CONStraints
  2  3
  1 -1
  1  1  1
 
 ADDCorrelation
 pbe
 
 SAVErage
 
 The keyword CONS has two compulsory arguments: the number
 of constrained NOs (in each irrep) to be used in the
 CNO-SCF calculation, followed by one line per irrep
 specifying the spin configuration of the so-called (+)
 wavelet (-1 --> beta, 1 --> alpha) The OPTIONAL keyword
 ADDC is used to include a correlation energy correction
 through a DFT functional specified as argument (LDA, LDA5,
 PBE and BLYP available at the moment) The OPTIONAL keyword
 SAVE forces the program to use spin-averaged wavelets.
:OFEM:A: :
 Performs a Orbital-Free Embedding (OFE)SCF calculation,
 available only in combination with Cholesky or RI integral
 representation. The runfile of the environment subsystem
 renamed AUXRFIL is required. An example of input for the
 keyword OFEM is the following:
 
 OFEMbedding
  ldtf/pbe
 dFMD
  1.0  1.0d2
 FTHAw
  1.0d-4
 
 The keyword OFEM requires the specification of two
 functionals in the form fun1/fun2, where fun1 is the
 functional used for the Kinetic Energy (available
 functionals: Thomas-Fermi, with acronym LDTF, and the NDSD
 functional), and where fun2 is the xc-functional (LDA,
 LDA5, PBE and BLYP available at the moment). The OPTIONAL
 keyword dFMD has two arguments: first, the fraction of
 correlation potential to be added to the OFE potential
 (zero for KSDFT and one for HF); second, the exponential
 decay factor for this correction (used in PES
 calculations). The OPTIONAL keyword FTHA is used in a
 freeze-and-thaw cycle (EMIL Do While) to specify the
 (subsystems) energy convergence threshold.
:Core:B: :
 The starting vectors are obtained from a diagonalization
 of the core Hamiltonian.
:LUMORB:B: :
 The starting vectors are taken from a previous SCFORB file
 called INPORB.
:FILEORB:B: :
 The starting vectors are taken from a previous SCFORB
 file, specified by user.
:GssRunfile:B: :
 The starting vectors are taken from the orbitals produced
 by Guessorb.
:HLgap:B: :
 This keyword is used to make the program levelshift the
 virtual orbitals in such a way that the HOMO LUMO gap is
 at least the value specified on the next line. This will
 help convergence in difficult cases but may lead to that
 it converges to an excited configuration. A suitable value
 is 0.2.
:Scramble:A: :
 This keyword will make the start orbitals slightly
 scrambled, accomplished by making a few small random
 orbital rotations. How much the orbitals are scrambled is
 determined by the parameter read on the next entry. A
 reasonable choice for this parameter is 0.2 which
 correspond to maximum rotation angle of arcsin(0.2). Using
 this keyword may be useful for UHF calculations with same
 number of alpha and beta electrons that are not closed
 shell cases.
:Orbitals:A: :
 Specifies the number of orbitals in the subspace of the
 full orbital space defined by the basis set, in which the
 SCF energy functional is optimized. The size of this
 subspace is given for each of the irreducible
 representations of the subgroup of D2h. If this keyword is
 not specified when starting orbitals are read, the full
 orbital space is assumed. The keyword takes as argument
 nIrrep (# of irreps) integers. Note that this keyword is
 only meaningful when the SCF program is fed with input
 orbitals (cf. LUMORB).
:Frozen:A: :
 Specifies the number of orbitals not optimized during
 iterative procedure. The size of this subspace is given
 for each of the irreducible representations of the
 subgroup of D2h. If this keyword is not specified the
 number of frozen orbitals is set to zero for each
 irreducible representation. If the starting vectors are
 obtained from a diagonalization of the bare nuclei
 Hamiltonian the atomic orbitals with the lowest
 one-electron energy are frozen. If molecular orbitals are
 read from the file INPORB the frozen orbitals are those
 that are read in first in each symmetry. The keyword takes
 as argument nIrrep (# of irreps) integers.
:Ovldelete:A: :
 Specifies the threshold for deleting near linear
 dependence in the basis set. The eigenvectors of the
 overlap matrix with eigenvalues less than that threshold
 are removed from the orbital subspace, and do not
 participate in the optimization procedure. The default
 value is 1.0d-5. The keyword takes as argument a (double
 precision) floating point number. Note that the SCFORB
 file will contain the deleted orbitals as a complemental
 set to the actual SCF orbitals! In future use of this
 orbital file the complemental set should always be deleted
 from use.
:Prorbitals:A: :
 Specifies which orbitals are to be printed in the logfile
 (standard output). The keyword takes as argument two
 integers. The possible values of first argument are:
 0 --- No orbitals printed;
 1 --- orbitals with orbital energies smaller than
       2E(homo)-E(lumo) are printed; and
 2 --- followed by real number (ThrEne) --- orbitals with orbital
       energies smaller than ThrEne are printed.
 Default value is 1. Second (optional) argument specifies a
 format:
 0 --- No orbitals printed
 1 --- Print only one-electron energies and occupation numbers
 2 --- Short print format
 3 --- Extended print format
:prlscf:A: :
 Specifies the general print level of the calculation. An
 integer has to be supplied as argument. The default value,
 1, is recommended for production calculations.
:ROBU:A: :
 Robust LDF integral representation (non-hybrid KS-DFT
 only). Requires Local Density Fitting (LDF) in SEWARD.
 This is the default for LDF.
:NR-2:A: :
 Nonrobust LDF integral representation with 2-index
 integrals only (non-hybrid KS-DFT only). Requires Local
 Density Fitting (LDF) in SEWARD. Default is robust
 integral representation.
:NR-3:A: :
 Nonrobust LDF integral representation with 3-index
 integrals only (non-hybrid KS-DFT only). Requires Local
 Density Fitting (LDF) in SEWARD. Default is robust
 integral representation.
:XIDI:A: :
 Use exact integral diagonal blocks with LDF. Reduces the
 risk of negative eigenvalues of the approximate integral
 matrix. Default is to not use exact integral diagonal
 blocks.
:Thresholds:A: :
 Specifies convergence thresholds. Four individual
 thresholds are specified as arguments, which have to be
 fulfilled simultaneously to reach convergence: EThr, DThr
 and FThr specify the maximum permissible difference in
 energy, density matrix elements and Fock matrix elements,
 respectively, in the last two iterations. The DltNTh
 finally specifies the norm of the orbital displacement
 vector used for the orbital rotations in the
 second-order/C2-DIIS procedure. The corresponding values
 are read in the order given above. The default values are
 1.0d-9, 1.0d-4, 1.5d-4, and 0.2d-4, respectively. Note
 that these thresholds automatically define the threshold
 used in the direct Fock matrix construction to estimate
 individual contributions to the Fock matrix such that the
 computed energy will have an accuracy that is better than
 the convergence threshold.
:NoDIIS:A: :
 Disable the DIIS convergence acceleration procedure.
:DIISthr:A: :
 Set the threshold on the change in density, at which the
 DIIS procedure is turned on. The keyword takes as argument
 a (double precision) floating point number. The default
 value is 0.15.
:QNRTHR:A: :
 Set the threshold on the change in density, at which the
 second-order/C2-DIIS procedure kicks in. The keyword takes
 as argument a (double precision) floating point number.
 The default value is 0.15. Note: the change in density has
 to drop under both the DIISthr and the QNRThr threshold,
 for the second-order/C2-DIIS to be activated. If the
 latter is set to zero the older first order C2-DIIS
 procedure will be used instead.
:C1DIIS:A: :
 Use C1-DIIS for convergence acceleration rather than
 C2-DIIS which is the default (not recommended).
:NODAMP:A: :
 Disable the Damping convergence acceleration procedure.
:Occnumbers:A: :
 Gives the option to specify occupation numbers other than
 0 and 2. This can be useful for generating starting
 orbitals for open shell cases. It should be noted however,
 that it is still the closed shell SCF energy functional
 that is optimized, thus yielding unphysical energies.
 Occupation numbers have to be provided for all occupied
 orbitals. In the case of UHF calculation occupation
 numbers should be specified on two different entries: for
 alpha and beta spin
:IVO:A:GUI:keyword:
 Specifies that the virtual orbitals are to be improved for
 subsequent MCSCF calculations. The core Hamiltonian is
 diagonalized within the virtual orbital subspace, thus
 yielding as compact orbitals as possible with the
 constraint that they have to be orthogonal to the occupied
 orbitals. Note that this option must not be used whenever
 the Hartree-Fock wavefunction itself is used as a
 reference in a subsequent calculation.
:nominimization:A: :
 Program will use density differences D(k)-D(k-1) rather
 than minimized differences.
:ONEGrid:A: :
 Disable use of a smaller intermediate grid in the
 integration of the DFT functional during the first SCF
 iterations.
:Rfpert:A: :
 This keyword will add a constant reaction field
 perturbation to the bare nuclei hamiltonian. The
 perturbation is read from RUNOLD (if not present defaults
 to RUNFILE) and is the latest selfconsistent perturbation
 generated by one of the programs SCF or RASSCF.
:STAT:A: :
 This keyword will add an addition print outs with
 statistic information
:conventional:A: :
 This option will override the automatic choice between the
 conventional and the direct SCF algorithm such that the
 conventional method will be executed regardless of the
 status of the ORDINT file.
:Disk:A: :
 This option enables/disables the semi-direct algorithm. It
 requires two arguments which specifies the max Mbyte of
 integrals that are written on disk during the first
 iteration (and retrieved later in subsequent iterations)
 and the size of the I/O buffer in kbyte. The default
 values are 2000 MByte and 512 kByte. In case the specified
 disk space is zero and the I/O buffer is different from
 zero it will default to a semi-direct SCF with in-core
 storage of the integrals. The size of the memory for
 integrals storage is the size of the corresponding I/O
 buffer. If the size of the disk is non-zero and the I/O
 buffer size is zero the latter will be reset to the
 default value.
:Thize:A: :
 This option specifies a threshold for two-electron
 integrals. Only integrals above this threshold (but not
 necessarily all of those) are kept on disk for the
 semi-direct algorithm. The keyword takes as argument a
 (double precision) floating point number.
:Simple:A: :
 If this option is specified, only a simple prescreening
 scheme, based solely on the estimated two-electron
 integral value will be employed (no density involved).
[SEWARD]

 spin-orbital eigenstates) for which g, D and higher
 magnetic tensors will be calculated. The program reads two
 lines: the first is the number of multiplets (NMULT) and

 the dimension of each multiplet. By default, the code will
 first analyze the energy spectra by itself and will
 compute the g and D tensors for ten low-lying groups of
 states. By using this keyword the user overwrites the
 default.
:TINT:B: :
 Specifies the temperature points for the evaluation of the
 magnetic susceptibility. The program will read four
 numbers: Tmin, Tmax, nT, and dltT0. Units of temperature =
 Kelvin (K).

 corresponding anisotropy axes, at the distance of 1.0
 angstrom from the metal site.

 This keyword must be used after the TULLY keyword. It
 enables the decoherence correction in the population
 density matrix as reported by Persico--Granucci.
:SUBStep:A: :
 This keyword must be used after the TULLY keyword. It
 specifies how many steps of integration we use to
 interpolate/extrapolate between two Newton's consecutive
 steps.
:PSUB:B: :
 This keyword must be used after the TULLY keyword. To
 print in molcas output D matrix, A matrix, B matrix,
 probabilities, randoms, population and energies at each
 substep.
:DMTX:A: :
 This keyword must be used after the TULLY keyword. Initial
 A matrix (population density matrix). It is a complex
 matrix. In the first line after the keyword you must
 specify its dimension N. Then N lines (with N values each
 line) with the REAL part of the matrix followed by N more
 lines with the imaginary part.
:FRANdom:A: :
 This keyword must be used after the TULLY keyword. It
 fixes the random number to one provided by the user, in
 case a deterministic trajectory is needed.
:ISEEd:A: :
 This keyword must be used after the TULLY keyword. The
 initial seed number is read from the input file. Then,
 seed numbers are modified (in a deterministic way), saved
 in the RunFile and read in the next call to the module.
 This way, MD simulations are reproducible.
:MAXHop:A: :
 This keyword must be used after the TULLY keyword. It
 specifies how many non-adiabatic transitions are allowed
 between electronic states.
