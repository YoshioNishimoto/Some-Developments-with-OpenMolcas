                   The ANO-RCC basis sets

The basis functions have been generated using the Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian
and thus include scalar relativistic effects.

The basis sets have been generated using CASPT2 natural orbitals for the atom in
different electronic states, for the positive ion, and in some cases also the
negative ion, and for the atom in a polarized field. For the main group elements
calculations on the diatom has instead been used to obtain the polarization
functions. A density matrix that is averaged over all these states have been
used to generate the final ANOs (using the program GENANO).

The basis set also includes correlation of the semi-core orbitals. Core
correlating, polarization and valence correlating functions are thus mixed
among the ANOs and the normal counting procedure becomes more intricate.
Rather large basis sets have to be used if these effects are to be
included completely. If you intend to use only a limited basis set, you have to
inspect the basis functions to see, which of them correlate the core. In Be,
for example, the second and fourth 3d correlates the 1s, as does the second 4f.

All elements of the periodic table up to curium are included.
It is recommended to use this basis set instead of the ANO-L basis set for all
atoms.
