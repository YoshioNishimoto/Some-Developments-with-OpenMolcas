c  nsymm specifies the symmetry of the sphere grid used to average the magnetization
c   nsymm=1  for half sphere
c   nsymm=2  for a quarter of a sphere
c   nsymm=3  for an octant of a sphere
c  other values for "nsymm" are not allowed
c
c   ngrid = defines the size of the Lebedev grid
c   ngrid = 1 the smallest grid
c   ngrid =32 the largest grid
c   get_nP - array Returning the number of the Lebedev grid for a defined symmetry and grid_number

      Integer nsymm, ngrid, get_nP(3,32)
      common/xgrid/ nsymm, ngrid, get_nP
